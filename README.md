# Drawing Rain

A p5.js sketch based on Golan Levin's software, Yellow Tail (www.flong.com). The strokes an interactor draws will repeat and move along the paths of the original drawings.

The intention of this sketch is to borrow this behaviour to render the movement and appearance of the rain: as you draw the rain, the rain will drop.

This sketch is largely based on Naoto Hieda's (naotohieda.com) javascript port for Gloan's (www.flong.com) original processing sketch, with additional visual adjustments optimized for mobile devices.
